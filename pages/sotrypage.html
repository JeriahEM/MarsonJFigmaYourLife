        <p>Sly was born into the long lineage of master thieves known as the Coopers. As Sly grew up, he learned about his family's history as master thieves. At the age of eight, he was to follow in their footsteps and inherit their legacy, a book called the Thievius Raccoonus. However, tragedy struck when, on the night Sly was to inherit the book, a mysterious gang of criminals known as the Fiendish Five infiltrated the Cooper home. Try as he might, Conner failed to defend himself, his wife and his son from the gang, resulting in the death of both parents. The Fiendish Five ransacked the house in search of the Thievius Raccoonus as Sly watched helplessly from the closet. Once the villains found the book, they tore it into five parts before leaving.</p>

    <div class="col-4" style="margin-top: 10%;"><p>Orphaned and with no money or a place to stay, Sly was placed in an orphanage, where he met his now lifelong friends Bentley and Murray. With their encouragement, Sly was determined to live up to his namesake as an accomplished thief. Ten years after the Fiendish Five stole the Thievius Raccoonus, Sly had garnered a worldwide reputation as a cunning thief. He and the gang embarked on a quest to steal back his inheritance and avenge his parents' deaths. With the entire Fiendish Five defeated, Sly expressed his pride in managing to recover his family heirloom. He acknowledged the help he had from Bentley and Murray, who stuck with him through it all, even though it was not easy for them. Commenting on both of their abilities, he realized how lucky he was to have friends like them, and could never ask for better ones.</p></div>
